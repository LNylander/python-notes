***1)*** `os.stat(<string>)` will give you the stats of a file that you specify
  - By default, it will print out a bunch of stuff. You can specify which info you want by using a dot.
  `os.stat(<string>).st_size` will return only the size of the specified document.
  - `st_mtime` represents the last time the document was modified
    - If you want to represent this information in a meaningful way, use the "datetime" module
