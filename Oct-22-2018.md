**1)** in an __init__ method, the parameters don't have to match the variable names inside the method itself. For example,

```
Class Die():

    def __init__(self, numSides):
        self.sides = numSides
        
    def getSides(self):
        return self.sides
        
d6 = Die(6)

print(d6.getSides())

```

is completely valid.
