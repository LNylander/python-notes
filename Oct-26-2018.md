**1)** Characters in strings can be accessed via their indices, like so:

```
s = "A String"
print(s[0])
```

This would return, "A"

***2)*** You can enter a negative number for a string index, and it will start from the back

```
s = "A String"
print(s[-1])
```

This would return "g"

***3)*** You cannot change strings after you create them. They are immutable.

```
s = "A String"
s[5] = "o"
print(s)
```

This does ***not*** work!

***4)*** You can "slice" strings, accessing only certain parts of them. The syntax looks like:

```
s = "Bread"
print(s[0:3])
```

This would print "Bre". The boundaries are somewhat like the Range() function. It includes the first value, but stops at the last value. So 0:3 prints the values at 0, 1, and 2.

***5)*** You can use the keyword "in" to determine whether or not a certain substring is contained within a larger string. You can also use "not in" do to the opposite

```
s = "Superman"
return "man" in s
```

This would return True, as the string "man" is in the string "Superman".
