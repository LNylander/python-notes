Variables with a double underscore in front of them can't be accessed from outside of a class. These are called "internal variables"

```
class Thing():
  def __init__(self, myValue=1):
      self.__value = myValue
      
def main():
    newThing = Thing()
    print(newThing.__value)

```
This would ***not*** work, because `newThing.__Value` is attempting to access an internal variable. Instead, use getters and setters to access the internal variable like so:

```
class Thing():
  def __init__(self, myValue=1):
      self.__value = myValue
      
  def getValue(self):
      return self.__value
      
def main():
    newThing = Thing()
    print(newThing.getValue())
```
