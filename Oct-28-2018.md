***1)*** There are two main types of input handling - state checking and event handling.
  - State Checking handles input in real time. As a state function is called, the program checks what is being input at that moment in time.
    - Pros: Gives you precision, and you can see when multiple events are happening at once
    - Cons: Doesn't tell you the order of actions, and you can miss actions if they happen in between calls
  - Event Handling creates a list of events for the computer to process at its own pace
    - Pros: We know the order of input
    - Cons: If the queue gets too long, can cause input lag
    
***2)*** We'll be focusing on Event Handling. The main method we need to worry about is *pygame.event.get()*. This method emptys the queue into a list, which we can then handle. Consider the following code:

```
running = True

while running:
  for e in pygame.event.get():
    if e.type == pygame.QUIT:
      running = False
      
```

This creates a list, e, that contains all of the events that have been input in between now and when *pygame.event.get()* was called last. It runs through this for loop until it gets through the whole event queue, and then (assuming the user has not triggered the QUIT event) empties the queue again and starts over.
