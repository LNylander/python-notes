***1)*** Strings are iterable, meaning they're made of elements that you can count. Therefore, you can loop through their elements just as you would a list. For example:

```
str = "HELLO"

for i in s:
  print(i)
```
This code would loop through the characters in the string "HELLO" and print them line by line.
