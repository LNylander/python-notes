***1)*** In order to make the following matrix,
```
 1  2  3  4  5
 6  7  8  9 10
11 12 13 14 15
16 17 18 19 20
```

Do something like this:

```
myList = []
counter = 1

for r in range(4):
  r = []
  for c in range(5):
    r.append(counter)
    counter += 1
    
  myList.append(r)
```

Create each row individually in the inner loop, and after the inner loop finishes append it to the larger list.
