***1) Useful Commands:***
  - `os.getcwd()` stands for "get current working directory", and returns the directory that you're currently in
  - `os.chdir(<string>)` stands for "change directory", and changes your directory to the directory you specify with a string
  - `os.listdir(<string>)`
    - Without parameters, lists files and folders of the directory you're currently in
    - If you pass in a string referencing a directory, it will list the files and folders in there instead
  - If you want to make a new directory, there are two ways do to it:
    1) `os.mkdir(<string>)` makes a directory, but doesn't allow for you to make multiple directories at once
    2) `os.makedirs(<string>)` makes a directory. Allows you to make multiple levels at once. Just use this one instead.
